### Hi, I'm Raluca and ...

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my data viz portfolio
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to realize vizualisations in D3
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with D3 and React
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... **endogeneity** or have a look at **REndo**, the R package we developed together with my colleagues at University of Zurich -https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/REndo/REndo.pdf

I get inspired by:
- **Georgia Lupi** - http://giorgialupi.com/
- **Shirley Wu** (to whom I am thankful sharing the name of the tools used for her vizualisations) - https://shirleywu.studio/

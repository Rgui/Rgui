### Hi, I'm Raluca and ...

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving my data viz portfolio
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to realize vizualisations in D3
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with D3 and React
- 💬 Ask me about ... **endogeneity** or have a look at **REndo**, the R package we developed together with my colleagues at University of Zurich -https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/REndo/REndo.pdf

I get inspired by:
- **Georgia Lupi** - http://giorgialupi.com/
- **Shirly Wu** (to whom I am thankful sharing the name of the tools used for her vizualisations) - https://shirleywu.studio/
